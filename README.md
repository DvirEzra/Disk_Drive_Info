# Disk_Drive_Info
This PowerShell script, disk_drive_info.ps1, allows you to retrieve disk drive information from remote computers specified in a text file and export the results to a CSV file. The script leverages WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) to collect data about fixed hard disk drives from multiple remote machines.
